# Sign-Language-Recognition
"Sign Language Gesture Recognition Using CNN" project is used to recognize sign language gestures through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project employs a pre-trained model to effectively identify hand gestures in sign language, making communication more accessible for the hearing-impaired community.
